## Week 4
In week 3 we strated our development process and by the end of week 3 we were to have a fully functional site.
The Feedback I received had me validate my code since I had some errors in my HTML. I also adjusted some fonts to make
the site more appealing and modern looking. I went back through my Bootstrap research and combed through the videos
on navigation. I created a navbar with a light background and when the site hits a mobile device the navigation
elements collapse and stack on one another making it easy to navigate the site regardless of screen size...

### Work Updated

- Updated body fonts such as P tags list items etc. to a sans serif style font
- Updated H2 tags to give a more modern looking site
- Validated all code in project to 100% 
- Added navigation bar
- Navigation bar reacts with all screen sizes 
- Fixed Lightbox bug I was having and got it working correctly
