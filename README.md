This week has a few accomplishable tasks that I will begin work on.- To begin this week I have created this repository and page to build my site in.- Next I have scheduled an interview with my professor in order to set some goals for myself within in this course.- I have a fair amount of research to do this week as well so I have begun the process of watching and reading all related content to the task at hand this week.- I need to comb through the site provided to us to find a suitable template to further build my site on.- Lastly once all the other tasks are complete I will begin work on my site and stick to the parameters given with the assignment.
